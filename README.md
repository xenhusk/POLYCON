# POLYCON  
**A Cross-Platform Consultation System with Comparative Analysis and AI-Driven Minutes Recorder**

## üìò Project Description
POLYCON is a comprehensive system designed to enhance faculty-student consultations by addressing common challenges such as scheduling conflicts and inconsistent documentation. Leveraging AI-powered transcription, comparative analytics, and an automated scheduling system, POLYCON streamlines the consultation process and delivers actionable, data-driven insights for both faculty and students.

## üßæ Abstract
Faculty-student consultations are essential for academic success, yet traditional methods face challenges such as scheduling conflicts and inconsistent documentation. This study introduces POLYCON, a cross-platform consultation system integrating AI-driven transcription and comparative analytics to enhance efficiency and accessibility. The system streamlines scheduling, ensures seamless faculty availability management, and provides accurate documentation and insights through comparative analytics. Developed using Agile methodology, the system utilizes PostgreSQL, React.js, and Flask. Testing shows improved consultation efficiency, reduced administrative workload, and enhanced user satisfaction.
